## Course challenges

This course is a series of problem/solution sequences.

You work on a challenge, and then can compare your approach with the provided solution.

There are three sections to this workshop, as detailed below.

---

## 1. Button Section

In this section, we'll take a series of hardcoded buttons with repeating Tailwind classes, and extract the styles into dynamic, composable groups that map a Button component's style variant props.

The challenges for this section are located in `src/workshop/button`. Each challenge ID corresponds to the URL for a given challenge.

For example, the challenge you can see at `https://localhost:3000/button/02-04-01` will be located in `src/workshop/button/02-04-01`.

## 2. Modal Section

In this section, we'll leverage Headless UI to drastically improve the usability and accessibility of a Modal component. We'll then implement multiple style variants, making options available for the modal size, tone and slide-in animation direction.

The challenges for this section are located in `src/workshop/modal`. Each challenge ID corresponds to the URL for a given challenge.

For example, the challenge you can see at `https://localhost:3000/modal/03-04-01` will be located in `src/workshop/modal/03-04-01`.

## 3. Calendar-day Section

This challenge is based on some real world scenario that I faced myself when building the [Calendar App](https://calendar-app.protailwind.com).

Time after time, as I built the app from scratch to discover some interesting teaching moments, I ended up making a mess with the Calendar component.

The challenges for this section are located in `src/workshop/calendar-day`. Each challenge ID corresponds to the URL for a given challenge.

For example, the challenge you can see at `https://localhost:3000/calendar-day/04-04-01` will be located in `src/workshop/calendar-day/04-04-01`.
